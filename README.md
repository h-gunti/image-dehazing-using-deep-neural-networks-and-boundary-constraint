The deterioration of digital image quality results in severe degradation of visibility and it affects the performance of various vision-based tasks. For instance, a self-driving system or even a human driver can be deprived of 
vision when facing inclement weather conditions which can result in unfortunate accidents and fatalities. Hence, visibility enhancement is an extremely critical task in real-world applications. Haze is an atmospheric 
phenomenon caused by the scattering of light by airborne particles and aerosols, reducing contrast, color accuracy, and overall image quality. Image dehazing is a critical process in computer vision to improve the 
visibility of images captured in the air. Image defogging technology aims to eliminate or reduce the effects of fog, thereby restoring clear and detailed images. Several technologies such as computer vision, image 
processing and machine learning are being used to develop Image dehazing systems in recent years. Embedding Neural Networks into existing systems is one of the emerging technologies in this field. In this project, a deep 
neural network and boundary constraint is used to detect haze from the image, which is then removed

The image dehazing system effectively addresses the challenge of enhancing image clarity by reducing haze, which improves visibility and detail. By integrating user-friendly interfaces, robust image 
processing algorithms, and advanced machine learning techniques, the system provides a reliable solution for producing clearer and more vibrant images. The use of algorithms such as Dark Channel Prior and 
modern deep learning approaches ensures high-quality results across various image conditions. The system's design facilitates ease of use, efficient processing, and high adaptability to different image 
formats and sizes. Overall, it enhances user experience by offering a practical tool for image enhancement in diverse applications. 

Future developments in the image dehazing system could focus on several key areas. Enhancing the system's performance by integrating more advanced deep learning models could improve the quality of 
dehazing, particularly in challenging scenarios with severe haze. Expanding the system's capabilities to handle real-time video dehazing could broaden its application to dynamic content. Additionally, 
incorporating real-time processing and cloud-based solutions could offer scalability and improved accessibility. Ongoing research into adaptive algorithms and integration with other image enhancement 
techniques may further optimize the systemâ€™s accuracy and efficiency. Collaboration with user feedback and continuous testing will be essential for refining and expanding the system's functionality to meet 
evolving needs and technological advancements.
